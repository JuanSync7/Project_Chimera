# Project Chimera: AI Chip Design Strategy

Project Chimera is a Next.js application that presents a comprehensive strategic blueprint for AI-driven semiconductor design. It dynamically showcases the project's architecture, an AI-powered design pipeline, the human-AI symbiosis, risk analysis, a long-term vision, and a detailed implementation roadmap.

## Core Features

*   **Interactive Presentation:** A server-rendered application built with Next.js, providing an interactive and performant experience.
*   **Scroll-Activated Navigation:** The header navigation on the main page highlights the currently viewed section based on scroll position.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS, including a mobile-friendly menu.
*   **Thematic Styling:** Features a dark theme with a configurable color palette via CSS variables, gradient text effects, and modern UI components from ShadCN.
*   **Animated Elements:** Includes subtle animations like a starry background and an animated rocket to add visual interest.
*   **Detailed Sub-Pages:** Uses the Next.js App Router for clean, file-based routing to detailed content pages.
